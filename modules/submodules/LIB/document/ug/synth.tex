A simple {\tt .tcl} script is provided for the Cadence Genus synthesis tool. The
script reads the technology files, compiles and elaborates the design, and
proceeds to synthesize it. The timing constraints are contained within the
constraints file provided, or provided in a separate file.

After synthesis, reports on silicon area usage, power consumption, and timing
closure are generated. A post-synthesis Verilog file is created, to be used in
post-synthesis simulation.
