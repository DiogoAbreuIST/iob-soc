The provided testbench uses the core instance described in
Section~\ref{sec:inst}. A high-level block diagram of the testbench is shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:tbbd}. The testbench is organized in a modular fashion, with
each test described in a separate file. The test suite consists of all the test
case files to make adding, modifying, or removing tests easy.
